For drawing the images different alogrithms/AIs can be used. One of them is for example [VQGAN](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2021/08/08/clip-vqgan/) which stands for __Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network__.

#### 03 [VQGAN](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2021/08/08/clip-vqgan/) + [CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip) on Google Colab
There is a given [setup](https://colab.research.google.com/github/justinjohn0306/VQGAN-CLIP/blob/main/VQGAN%2BCLIP(Updated).ipynb#scrollTo=g7EDme5RYCrt&uniqifier=1) available on Google Colab, which can be filled with "init image" and "target images" (more than one possible) and some further parameters. A detailed description can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lu7XPRKlNhBQjcKr8k8qRzUzbBW7kzxb5Vu72GMRn2E/edit#heading=h.7bt2ltvefvkz).
In the subfolder "03_VQGAN_CLIP" results of different parametrizations can be found.

## Conlusion so far
Most of the text-to-image generators are more likely used for artistic generation of images instead of using them for realistic image augmentation for weather conditions.
Adding an animal like a dog for example into an image is not a problem, but adding spray which is not a separable object is quite challenging.
